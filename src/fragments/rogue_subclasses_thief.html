				<h2 data-icon="crossbow">Thief</h2>
				<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype—but so do treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators.</p>
				<p>In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span>Roguish Exploits</h3>
				<p>Add the following four exploits to your list of exploit options: heist, pickpocket, robbery, and slink.</p>

				<h4 class="h4--option">Heist</h4>
				<p>When you make an ability check and use Deception or Sleight of Hand, you can roll 1d6 and add it to the result. You can wait until after you roll your check before deciding to use this exploit, but you must decide before the GM says whether your check succeeds or fails.</p>
				<p><strong>Greater Heist:</strong> (5th-level) Your bonus increases from 1d6 to 1d8.</p>
				<p><strong>Superior Heist:</strong> (9th-level) Your bonus increases from 1d8 to 1d10.</p>

				<h4 class="h4--option">Pickpocket</h4>
				<p>When you hit an adjacent Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack and you have at least one free hand, you can attempt to pickpocket it. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you take hold of one item of your choice that the creature carries and is not currently wearing or wielding.</p>
				<p>You must be able to hold your pickpocketed item comfortably with one hand. If you had advantage on your attack roll, the creature is not immediately aware that they have been pickpocketed by you.</p>
				<p><strong>Greater Pickpocket:</strong> (5th-level) You can use this exploit against Huge creatures.</p>
				<p><strong>Superior Pickpocket:</strong> (9th-level) You can use this exploit against Gargantuan creatures.</p>

				<h4 class="h4--option">Robbery</h4>
				<p>When you deal your sneak attack damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can attempt to make the creature drop an item. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature drops one item of your choice that it is holding.</p>
				<p>If you are adjacent to the creature, you can catch the dropped item if you are unrestrained and have at least one free hand.</p>
				<p><strong>Greater Robbery:</strong> (5th-level) You can use this exploit against Huge creatures.</p>
				<p><strong>Superior Robbery:</strong> (9th-level) You can use this exploit against Gargantuan creatures.</p>

				<col-break></col-break>

				<h4 class="h4--option">Slink</h4>
				<p>When a creature hits you with an attack roll and you are not incapacitated, you can spend your reaction and attempt to evade the attack. Roll 1d6 and add the result to your AC—if the attack roll doesn't beat your slink AC, it misses.</p>
				<p><strong>Greater Slink:</strong> (5th-level) You may roll 1d8 when you attempt to slink.</p>
				<p><strong>Superior Slink:</strong> (9th-level) You may roll 1d10 when you attempt to slink.</p>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">1</span>Fast Hands</h3>
				<p>You can spend a bonus action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the <i>Use an Object</i> action.</p>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">3</span>Second-Story Work</h3>
				<p>You gain the ability to climb faster than normal—climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>
				<p>In addition, whenever you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">7</span>Supreme Sneak</h3>
				<p>You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>

				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">9</span>Stolen Secrets</h3>
				<p>You have acquired enough magical knowledge that you can now improvise the use of items—even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>
				<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> If an item requires you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item, your spellcasting ability modifier is +0.</p>
