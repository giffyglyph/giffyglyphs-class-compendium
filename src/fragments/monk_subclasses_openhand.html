				<h3><span class="h3__highlight">10</span>Quivering Palm</h3>
				<p>When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can attempt to create deadly vibrations within their body. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the creature is afflicted with imperceptible vibrations that last until you next finish a long rest.</p>
				<p>You can spend an action to resonate these vibrationsâ€”at which point, the vibrations end and the creature suffers 5d10 necrotic damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, it dies immediately.</p>
				<p>You can use this feature once, and you regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
