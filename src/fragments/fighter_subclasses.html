				<h1 id="fighter-subclasses">Martial Archetypes</h1>
				<p>No two fighters are the same—your personal tastes define your fighting style. Swords, bows, or fists? Aggressive or defensive? Elegant and refined, or harsh and brutal? Long range or up-close and personal?</p>
				<p>Choose a <i>Martial Archetype</i> to help perfect your own, unique style on the battlefield.</p>

				<h2>Choose Your Archetype</h2>
				<p>Choose your archetype from one of the following options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Champion:</strong> You and your weapon are one. In battle, you know how to best exploit an opening in your enemy's defense to deal massive damage.</li>
					<li><strong>Defender:</strong> You protect your allies from harm. When you stand fast and hold your ground, nothing can escape your defender's mark.</li>
					<li><strong>Commander:</strong> In the chaos of battle, you know how to take charge. You give orders and you expect those orders to be followed.</li>
				</ul>

						<p><i>Fearless Fighter</i> is a work-in-progress with a limited number of archetypes. Future expansions of this supplement <i>may</i> (depending on demand and support) include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Spellsword:</strong> You favor both combat and magic, wielding a weapon in one hand and arcane power in the other.</li>
							<li><strong>Arbalest:</strong> From the backlines of battle, you rain suppressing fire down on your enemies and snipe targets from afar.</li>

				<h3>Creating an Archetype</h3>
				<p>To create your own <i>Martial Archetype</i> (or to convert an existing archetype from other sources), follow these steps:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Add 4 Maneuvers:</strong> At 1st-level, martial archetypes expand the fighter maneuver list with 4 unique maneuvers. Create interesting ways to act in battle that are thematic to your archetype—be flavorsome.</li>
					<li><strong>Create 3rd and 7th-level Features:</strong> Martial archetypes grant features at 3rd and 7th-level.</li>
					<li><strong>Create a 10th-level Capstone:</strong> At 10th-level, martial archetypes grant a unique capstone feature that is the pinnacle of your archetype's theming.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>And that's it, your archetype is complete!</p>
